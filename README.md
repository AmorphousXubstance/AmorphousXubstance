## -- ======== -- -- KNOW ME -- -- ======== --
> Hi, I’m @AmorphousXubstance, I go by my alias Sorairo Yorimitsu (空色頼光), a 1:1 linguistic and conceptual translation of my name. My real name is very unique, thus due to privacy (and pronunciation) concerns, call me Sora. I like explaining and never use anything I don't understand fully. I don't advocate for ctrl+c/ctrl+v solutions if there is no takeaway. I personally prefer FOSS, but have no problem with closed source consumer software.<br>
> (And I always make it a point to make my pfp describe my face accurately enough 🙃)
