## -- ======== -- -- KNOW ME -- -- ======== --
> Hi, I’m @AmorphousXubstance, you might know me by my alias Sorairo Yorimitsu (空色頼光), which is a 1:1 translation of my legal name in multiple layers. My real name is very rare and easily traceable, thus due to CyberSec concerns, call me Sora. I like explaining and never use anything I don't understand fully. I don't advocate for ctrl+c/ctrl+v solutions if there is no takeaway. I personally prefer FOSS, but have no problem with closed source consumer software.<br>
> (And I always make it a point to make my pfp describe my face accurately enough 🙃)
